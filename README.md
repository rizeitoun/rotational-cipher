# Rotational Cipher in C#
#### This is a Rotational Cipher exercise from the C# track of exercism.io.  Goal was to make a cs script to encode a message into a rotational cipher with a defined shift.

#### Implementation code is RotationalCipher
#### Example tests from exercism where Actual is what code outputs and Expected is the expected answer:
```
    public void Rotate_all_letters()
    {
        Assert.Equal("Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.", RotationalCipher.Rotate("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", 13));
    }

```
